# rowbot

Developed for maybe Erg-A-Thon?     

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
Copy the .example.env file to .env and fill in the values. You'll need a Client ID and Secret from Concept2, a Discord Bot Token and Client ID, and a couple ID's from within Discord. 

To run:

```bash
bun run index.js
```   
This command exposes http://localhost:3000.   
This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.6. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
